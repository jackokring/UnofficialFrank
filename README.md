# Documentation and Features

Experimental nightly builds only for now. No Mac builds yet. This is due to
needing OS 14 to get a build server queue, and that server getting a 302 redirect,
followed by a 404 on the Rack SDK download for the github build server.

This repository contains modules that I like, but are often dormant with some good
ideas in the issues tab. It's not to say that other modules aren't availablein the
[VCV Rack Plugin Directory](https://vcvrack.com/plugins), but this repository is a
collection of modules that have been developed further to be more useful. Apparent
Simplicity is often the key to a good module.

### Extras

- [X] `c` is for channel number (1 to 16)
- [X] `m` is for set poly out (1 to 16) ... ish!
- [X] `f` is for frequency (delayed by one sample)
- [X] `l` is for lowpass filter (delayed by one sample, 'f' relative)
- [X] `par(p)` is for parabolic phase `4*p*(1-p)`
- [X] `sub(p)` is for `p/2-0.5` (suboscillation multiplier for `par(p)`)
- [X] queing and unquing to `PORT_MAX_CHANNELS` (crosstalk)
 - [X] `que(x)` is for queuing (`que` evaluates to `x`)
 - [X] `unq(i)` is for unqueueing (index `i` is tail offset, 0 for tail)
- [X] `expm1(x)` is for `exp(x) - 1` (zero DC audio bias)
- [X] `log1p(x)` is for `log(1 + x)` (zero DC audio bias)
- [X] fuzzy equality/inequality (within 1 V)
- [X] optimized and threaded
- [X] new front panel layout
- [X] 11 HP

### Notes

This is a modulation source. Using `f` or `l` in the frequency formula (lower text box)
might sometimes be good, but can lead to very high frequencies at large amplitudes.
You are advised to place a lowpass filter after this module if you are listening
to the output directly, as the high-frequency artifacts can be very loud.
