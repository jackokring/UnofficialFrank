# Documentation and Features

Experimental nightly builds only for now. No Mac builds yet. This is due to
needing OS 14 to get a build server queue, and that server getting a 302 redirect,
followed by a 404 on the Rack SDK download for the github build server.

This repository contains modules that I like, but are often dormant with some good
ideas in the issues tab. It's not to say that other modules aren't availablein the
[VCV Rack Plugin Directory](https://vcvrack.com/plugins), but this repository is a
collection of modules that have been developed further to be more useful. Apparent
Simplicity is often the key to a good module.
